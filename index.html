      <h2> Hi, I'm Jessica</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
          I'm a full stack web developer based in Washington, DC
      </p>
      <p>
      but I haven't always been a web developer! I've spent the last 5 years working for a non-profit that introduces teens and college students to community service and shows them how they can get involved in their communities. In that time I've learned the value of planning, flexibility, good communication and how strong leadership can transform a team. I've brought all of those skills with me into my coding career and added skills in JavaScript, React, MongoDB, MySQL & Node.js.
        <br>
        When I'm not coding, I can probably be found volunteering at an animal shelter, drinking really good coffee, singing with my husband, reading, attending meetups to learn new things, or walking my dogs, Amy Pond and Albus Dumbledog.
        <br>
        I've always had a wide variety of interests and have spent the last 10 years exploring them and learning everything I can. In that time I have learned so many things, but some of the most important to me are: to value deadlines and attention to detail, to always be prepared, but never take myself to seriously, any problem can be solved with patience and persistance, a team is only as good as it's leader, and that everyone has something valuable to offer a team.
